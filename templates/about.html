                This Web Application takes the input from the user and database for a desired Indian satellite and based on
                the inputs specified by the user, projects the orbital positions on the Earth’s surface to generate the
                sensor footprint.

                Following are the inputs which can be provided by the user to the application to guide them
                for determining the imaging opportunities: <br><br>
                1) Coordinates of point of interest in terms of Latitude and Longitude on Earth. <br>
                2) Sensor within the payload. <br>
                3) Possible swath which can be imaged with the particular sensor. <br>
                4) Tilt of the satellite within the known agility of the platform. <br>
                5) Orbital parameters like semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination, longitude of ascending node,
                argument of perigee and true anomaly based on the publicly available information in the form
                of Two Line Elements (TLE).

            <p class="third-para">
                The objective is to find the possibility or predict the time of imaging a particular object/place
                (Lat-Long) on Earth by an Earth observing satellite with given sensor specifications, orbit
                and attitude definitions under various orbit perturbations.
            </p>

            <h3>Background :</h3>
            <p class="fourth-para">
                Low Earth observation satellites orbit the Earth surface at an altitude of around 300
                to 1000 km in sun-synchronous polar orbit. The sensors are placed on the satellite platform to take
                pictures of the Earth’s surface. Users are interested in the opportunities when their area of interest
                is going to be imaged to meet their application requirements. This
                software-based application enables them to know the imaging opportunities a priori for their
                planning. Agile satellite platforms have the capability to image certain areas with tilts which are
                defined by revisit constraints. This application guides the user for imaging their
                area of interest taking into account the tilt requirements. This information can be shared with the
                satellite pass programming personnel.
